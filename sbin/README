FStool 2014

The FStool process  used to be automated when I was only monitroing a single site.  The multi site
code is mostly finished by justs a few days to fix.  I only get asked a few time a year so I have not been 
under presure to fix this.  

Data collection is automated and happends twice a week for CTC

A whole seperate process is used to collect GPFS usage reports ( I think that is automated )

Steps for loading CTC-B Data from FStool Sources
- cd /data/fstool/sbin
- check that new data files have been generated.  Data collection happens twice a week.
  Data files are kept by site at /data/fstool/fsdata/CTC-B
  ls -l ../fsdata/CTC-B
./FSbatch.sh   
#FSbatch.sh is wrapper script for FSbatch.pl which creates the shell script -> fsload.sh
# fsload.sh imports CSV files from ../fsdata/CTC-B in MySQL; catess indexes; creates reports
# The whole fsload.sh script cotains the commands for all of CTC-B and can take 12 hours to complete.
# copy fsload to home.sh;  Edit home.sh so only home directories are loaded and reported on.

# Example of home.sh
# home
(/data/fstool/sbin/update.pl --load CTC-B home.csv CTCB_home > $LogDir/home.log ;\
 /data/fstool/sbin/update.pl --index CTC-B home.csv CTCB_home >> $LogDir/home.log ;\
 /data/fstool/sbin/fsreport.pl CTC-B home >> $LogDir/home.log ;\
    /data/fstool/sbin/fsdetail.pl CTC-B home >> $LogDir/home.log ;\
)

./PurgeOld.pl   # removes older versions of MYSQL tables
./home.sh  # Will load and report on CTC-B home dirs 

fsload.sh can fail if old tables are not purged: PurgeOld.pl will clean up old tables.

ISSUES
  - fsload.sh creates to many subprocesses; need a stack to manage X processes at a time
  - fsload.sh starts many subprocesses so the log files are out of order; maybe should create a log for each 
    subprocess ? 

UID Table can be updated with update_uid.pl  # Dec 2015 John Dey
  - this new version of update_uid uses the HPC LDAP
