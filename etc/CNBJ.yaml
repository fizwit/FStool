#Volume Name: 
#  volume attributes

#  source
#  path
#  fname
#  array
#  owner
#  detail
# 
#  Path - Mounted path that users see.
#  source - path that was used to collect data from. There are two ways to speicify path with fstool.
# this is due to NFS overmounts.  /SFS/project is a volume but there are multible volumes mounted over it.
# In order to perform a volume report that only shows /SFS/project files a seperate NFS mount needs to be
# made on a data collection system. The result is that path information does not match the actual path
# that users see. 
#
# detail reports path is appended to 'source' path to generate report. detail path is appended to 'path'
# when used for display purposes. Detail path of '/' (root) will give a directory level report at the root
# of the volume.
